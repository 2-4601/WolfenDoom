Description             : WolfenDoom: Blade of Agony is a story-driven action
			  mod in the spirit of Laz Rojas' work in the late 90's.
			  
			  You are the famous agent William "B.J." Blazkowicz, 
			  part of the allied resistance in the World War II. While
			  Europe is a battlefield and a quick german "Endsieg" is
		 	  out of reach, Hitler is looking for an occult artifact
			  to turn the tides: The Blade of Agony. It's your job now
			  to find the sword before Nazi Germany does!

Special Thanks		: Laz Rojas for his inspiration and the tremendous
			  	work he has done with his WolfenDoom addons.

			  Graf Zahl for GZDoom, randy for ZDoom, MaxEd for GZDoomBuilder

This is here as a reminder of the issues / to-do we notice from time to time.
Remove the problem / to-do from this list once it is done - OZY81

- Check all graphics / sprites / textures which may use some pngcrush (not much left for sure, Calinou may help us though: https://github.com/Realm667/WolfenDoom/pull/168)
- Fix actors crouching even if unaware of you: to test it simply play c3m1 and when you kill the guard near redkey door, confront enemies always crouched and killing them with the shovel
- Fix INTERMAP shop: when you buy the Sten gun, weapon gets raised and so you can shoot everywhere
- Fix strobe lights: StrobeEmitter & SpotLightBoA doesn't clamp geometry (noticeable since GZDoom 3.7.2)
- Get rid of nazibannertall.md2 model and replace it with a .md3 (problem is that it gets skin offsets messed up during conversion atm)
- Get some different sounds for bosses to turn each more distinct (not easy, should check on Wolf3d websites)
- Improve ENDOOM.ans
- Improve INTERMAP shop system as suggested by Talon1024 - https://github.com/Realm667/WolfenDoom/issues/166
- Optimize INTERMAP, C2M1 and C3M1 intros
- Remove redundant / unused resources (Denkmal & Mecha Hitler [HITL## frames] are still unused for example)
- Test all brightmaps, some actors seems to use too many spawned lights which can be removed (specially during attacks)
- Turn the whole project .ipk3 compatible (INTERMAP issue: if we watch the INTROMAP without skipping it, we can hear the HQs song once INTERMAP is loaded for a while, doesn't happen as .pk3 - Tested with GZDoom 4.1.3 Official)
- Verify actors behavior, mainly props and enemies (don't forget to check LightBulb on maps and optimize lasers)
- Verify every situation on maps where models disappear and use RenderRadius if needed

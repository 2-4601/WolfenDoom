This is here as a reminder of the issues we notice from time to time.
Remove the problem from this list once it got fixed - OZY81

**WHILE TYPING THIS LIST, I WAS UNDER GZDoom g3.7pre-12-g2ba614883**

- Ledge climb script should be improved to avoid players to fall from above, not sure how to solve this... maybe a special code like with zscript interactive walls but exclusively for ledge textures?
- Sprite shadows sometimes still fall out of bounds or 3d floors even if an actor is spawned / positioned 8-16mp high from them ->  The symptoms of this should be masked now, and shadows will behave more realistically for actors that are in the air; please test! - AFA
- Turn the whole project .ipk3 compatible (already tested a bit, probably needs some adjustments on sounds and a couple of things concerning textures / actors mainly)

This is here as a reminder of the issues we notice from time to time.
Remove the problem from this list once it got fixed - OZY81

**WHILE TYPING THIS LIST, I WAS UNDER GZDoom g3.7pre-12-g2ba614883**

- Get rid of all .md2 models and replace them with .md3 (animated banners)
- Optimize INTERMAP, C2M1 and C3M1 intros: while 80% of the slowdown comes with actors shown and portals (c3m1 could use a separate map for that IMHO, so also we won't be able to run over prisoners heads - they'll start to walk near the red door for example), is it possible to improve moving cameras code somehow? Not sure
- Turn the whole project .ipk3 compatible
- Verify every situation on maps where models disappear and use RenderRadius if needed

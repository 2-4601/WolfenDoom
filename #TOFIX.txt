This is here as a reminder of the issues we notice from time to time.
Remove the problem from this list once it got fixed - OZY81

**WHILE TYPING THIS LIST, I WAS UNDER GZDoom g3.7pre-12-g2ba614883**

- At the very start of TITLEMAP we can hear distinctly BJ panting because of Stamina going down (DoStaminaCheck from sprint.acs maybe?)
- Ledge climb script should be improved to avoid players to fall from above, not sure how to solve this... maybe a special code like with zscript interactive walls but exclusively for ledge textures?
- Longinus_Hitler still can't be hit by a Firebrand melee attack while its powered, once instead it should (since we can hit him ONLY with the Fireball)
- Sprite shadows sometimes still fall out of bounds or 3d floors even if an actor is spawned / positioned 8-16mp high from them
- Turn the whole project .ipk3 compatible (already tested a bit, probably needs some adjustments on sounds and a couple of things concerning textures / actors mainly)
- Underwater_sway shader seems to repeat lower parts of a sprite / texture with the result of a broken animation, and I tried cropping / offsetting frames with no avail (UWPLA-B-C0 sprites)

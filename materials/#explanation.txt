ROUGHNESS
defines the ability of the surface to reflect or absorb white light
- white makes the texture matte (rough)
  (as the lights remitted in all directions, good for bland surfaces)
- black makes the texture shiny (smooth)
  (as the light gets reflected, good for polished surfaces)

- black are shadows
- whitre are no shadows

METALLIC

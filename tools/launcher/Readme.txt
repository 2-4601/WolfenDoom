This is a simple launcher tool to start "gzdoom.exe -file boa_c2.wad" (can be updated).

Originally I posted this in the forums, it's been updated a bit now so that the command prompt window no longer stays up.

It does not build in any icons. If you want any, you'll have to add them. :)

This is built in Linux using MinGW-32. Using MSVC++ seems a bit overkill with this, but it should build just fine there, it'll require modifying a few things to get it working right, though.

Have fun!

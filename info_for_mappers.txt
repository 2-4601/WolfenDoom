THE ANATOMY OF MISSIONS AND MAPS
================================
There are three different kinds of missions
 - There is one main plot (Blade of Agony)
 - There are side plots which are mixed between and connected to the main plot
 - There are side plots which have nothing to do with the main plot

The main plot is maintained by Tormentor667, the side plots are maintined
by anyone who is working as a mapper on this project. As of now, the side
missions don't need to be connected to the main plot, but this can still be
done in later stages of the project if it makes sense.

Before each mission, you visit the intermission map (INTERMAP) where you
get the briefing for your upcoming task in a briefing room. In other rooms
you can apply for seperate missions (side plots not connected to the main plot)
or you can buy powerups or other stuff for upcoming missions with the treasure
you have collected. NPCs around the map will give you tipps and hints to make
the place more living.

This skeleton gives the player different choices in how to proceed next
and makes it possible to have a "open world" feeling to the mod. On the
other hand it's easy for various mappers to work on the project without
interfering with others.


THE STYLE OF MAPS
=================
Generally we are aiming for almost realistic style of maps, so places
to visit should resemble places that do exist or might exist.

Consistency is also very important, that's why things like toilets, 
doors, mirrors and other stuff you find over and over again should
look similar. To make things easier, the /maps/ folder also contains
prefabs you can load up in GZDoomBuilder.

Same goes to some kind of generic scripts (mirror breaker, toilet sounder,
etc.), just check the existing map C1M3 for good examples of generic
scripts you should use.

All maps must be UDMF format.
